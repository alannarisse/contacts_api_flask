# Contacts API

This Contacts API uses Flask. Today is my first time using Flask. It was an adventure!

## Installation and Use instructions
This Readme assumes you have already installed git, python, pip, and virtualenv.

### Instructions
1. Clone or download this repository and within a virtual env, run ```python app.py```

2. Point your browser to [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)

3. Click on the appropriate buttons on the homepage for Get, Post, Update, and Delete.

### Endpoints

- [View all contacts](http://localhost:5000/contacts) (dummy data only)
- [Create New Contact](http://localhost:5000/new_contact)
- [Update Contact](http://localhost:5000/contacts?id=1) (not working)
- [Delete Contact](http://localhost:5000/contacts?id=1)(not working)

### Not Complete:
- Authorization, had I gotten there, I probably would have used Flask-JWT
- Update - just plum ran out of time
- Delete - just plum ran out of time
